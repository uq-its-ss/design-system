# Sections #

## Overview ##
Sections are a Panel pane style that wrap panes. They provide a header with title and summary, and a footer field along with a range of themeing options.
They are primarily used on landing pages to create strips of content stacked vertically down the page, while containing the content to the same page column width.

## Usage ##
1. Add a pane to a Panel page. 
2. For that pane, use the Edit cog to select 'Change' from the Style group.
3. Choose the Section Style option and click Next.
4. Optionally, fill in the title, summary fields and set themeing options.
5. Save to apply the section style to the pane.

**Type:** Panel pane style

**Fields:**

* **Title** - Optional.
* **Summary** - Optional. Short summary text to accompany the section title and give context to the content below.
* **Footer** - Optional. Short text that displays below the section content.
* **Background image** - Optional. Applies the chosen image as a background to the section. It will be fitted to fully cover the section so it is recommended that the uploaded image be at least 1920px wide, and as tall as is needed to cover the amount of content in the section.

**Display options**
These settings allow a range of styling to be applied to the section. These include:

* **Top spacing** - Sets the amount of padding at the top of the section.
* **Bottom spacing** - Sets the amount of padding at the bottom of the section.
* **Theme**
    * **Default** - Sections have a white background by default.
    * **Shaded background** - Applies a light grey background to the section.
    * **Dark tint** - Applies a dark tint overlay to the section. This is for use with a background image so that the background image can be softly muted to allow content on top to display more clearly.
    * **Light tint** - Applies a light tint overlay to the section. As with the dark tint, this works in the opposite way, lightening the background image for better contrast with dark text on top. 
    * **Light text** - Sets the section title, summary, and footer text to white. For use in conjunction with the dark tint option.
    * **Dark text** - Sets the section title, summary, and footer text to dark grey. For use in conjunction with the light tint option.
* **Layout**
    * **Single column, centered** - Section header and footer are stacked above and below the section content, and are centered. The section content alignment is not affected by this setting.
    * **Single column, left-aligned** - Section header and footer are stacked above and below the section content, and are left aligned. The section content alignment is not affected by this setting.
    * **Two column, left-aligned** - Section header is shifted to the left of the section content and displayed in a 4/8 column arrangement.
