## Assets

These assets form the core layout of your email, including buttons, UQ header and other essential structural elements.

### Buttons

Buttons are used to create clear calls to action that encourage user interaction and drive engagement within your email.

#### Primary button

Use the primary button to highlight the most important call to action within the email, ideally limiting it to a single instance to maintain visual hierarchy and emphasis.

To use this primary button, select the ‘copy’ button in the right corner of the box below to copy the HTML code.

<Canvas of={buttonStories.buttonPrimary} />

#### Secondary button

Use the secondary button for important actions that are not the primary call to action, it has less visual emphasis than the primary button and can be used multiple times within an email.

To use this secondary button, select the ‘copy’ button in the right corner of the box below to copy the HTML code.

<Canvas of={buttonStories.buttonSecondary} />

## UQ header

Used across all UQ emails. Includes the UQ logo, linking to the UQ homepage, and a ‘View in browser’ link that opens the email in the user’s browser for easier viewing.

<Canvas of={headerStories.header} />

## Sender header

To help recipients recognise and trust UQ email communications, always use the full name of the area, faculty, school, or office in the sender name, with the acronym in brackets where relevant. This ensures students can quickly identify the source of the message, particularly when communications come from a faculty, school, division, or central office.

Examples:

- Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology (EAIT)
- Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioural Sciences (HABS)
- Business School
- From the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic)
- Institute for Teaching and Learning Innovation (ITaLI)

<Canvas of={senderHeaderStories.senderHeader} />

Includes:

- Acknowledgement of Country

**Image sizing**

- Large hero images are standard for Salesforce emails and can also be used in Oracle/Vision6 when appropriate.
- Small hero image is recommended for Oracle/Vision 6.

### Block footer

Used in non-social/marketing/mailing list emails to separate content from the footer.

## Content structure

Properly structuring your content is essential to ensure maximum accessibility and readability for your audience.

### Intro

The intro should be attention-grabbing and action-oriented, summarising the email’s main message.
Includes a headline, an optional description and/or call to action.

### Body section

Clearly communicate the email’s purpose.
Use headings, lists, and concise paragraphs for better readability.
Optional – add relevant images to enhance engagement.

### Content structure

- Left-align all content.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Follow a clear heading structure.
- More helpful guidelines on ensuring your content is accessible: [Accessibility author checklist]

### Call to actions (CTA)

- Use a single, prominent CTA button.
- Use secondary or tertiary style CTAs (ie. outline buttons or text links) for any additional calls to action.
- Write clear, action-oriented text ie. ‘Book a call back’ rather than ‘Learn more’.

### Imagery

- Optional – include images only if they add value to the content and align with the email’s purpose.
- Use images from the UQ Digital Asset Management (DAM) system. If you need to source images from elsewhere, you must obtain approval from the M&C Brand team: brand@uq.edu.au
- Avoid embedding text within images to maintain accessibility (exceptions to this must be approved by the M&C Brand team: brand@uq.edu.au).
- Include descriptive alternative text to ensure accessibility and meaningful context if images don’t load (avoid generic labels like ‘image’).

**Helpful links:**

- [UQ written style guide]
- [Accessibility author checklist]

## Technical guidelines

Keep these technical guidelines in mind when testing your emails.

### Ensure mobile-friendly design

A high percentage of users open emails on their mobile devices first. Make sure your email layout is responsive and easy to scan on smaller screens and confirm that images and text scale properly for a condensed format.

### Write clear preheader text

The preheader is a snippet of text that appears after the subject line in many inboxes. Use it to complement or reinforce the subject line, giving recipients more context before they open the email.

### Provide a fallback salutation

If personalisation merges fail, include a default greeting (ie. ‘Dear Student’) to maintain a professional and personal tone even if dynamic content doesn’t load.

### Test emails across multiple email clients and devices

Ensuring consistent formatting and functionality across different email clients (such as Gmail and Outlook) and platforms (iOS and Android) enhances user experience and credibility. Always conduct thorough cross-platform testing.

### Plan for images being blocked

Some email providers or users block images by default, include HTML-based text for all critical information. Use alternative text to convey key messages when images don’t display, ensuring recipients still receive important details.
