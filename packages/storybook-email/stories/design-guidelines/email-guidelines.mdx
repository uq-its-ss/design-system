## Assets

These assets form the core layout of your email, including the header, footer, and other essential structural elements.

### Header

Used across all UQ emails.
Includes the UQ logo, linking to the UQ homepage, and a ‘View in browser’ link that opens the email in the user’s browser for easier viewing.

### Sub-header

Use this for faculty or school emails to display the faculty or school name.

### Hero image

Optional – use only if it adds value, enhances engagement, or supports the email’s purpose.
Avoid using the UQ graphic device (purple wave graphic that aligns flush with the bottom edge of the hero image).

**Image sizing**

- Large hero images are standard for Salesforce emails and can also be used in Oracle/Vision6 when appropriate.
- Small hero image is recommended for Oracle/Vision 6.
- Include example of mobile display in guidelines to demonstrate different size displays for each image size.

### Icons

Using icons can help improve comprehension by providing clear visual cues that highlight key points, break up large blocks of text, and guide the reader’s eye.

We recommend using only the brand-approved icons listed below.

Include icons for download in Storybook?

### Block footer

Used in non-social/marketing/mailing list emails to separate content from the footer.

## Content structure

Properly structuring your content is essential to ensure maximum accessibility and readability for your audience.

### Intro

The intro should be attention-grabbing and action-oriented, summarising the email’s main message.
Includes a headline, an optional description and/or call to action.

### Body section

Clearly communicate the email’s purpose.
Use headings, lists, and concise paragraphs for better readability.
Optional – add relevant images to enhance engagement.

### Content structure

- Left-align all content.
- Use sentence case for headings.
- Follow a clear heading structure.
- More helpful guidelines on ensuring your content is accessible: [Accessibility author checklist]

### Call to actions (CTA)

- Use a single, prominent CTA button.
- Use secondary or tertiary style CTAs (ie. outline buttons or text links) for any additional calls to action.
- Write clear, action-oriented text ie. ‘Book a call back’ rather than ‘Learn more’.

### Imagery

- Optional – include images only if they add value to the content and align with the email’s purpose.
- Use images from the UQ Digital Asset Management (DAM) system. If you need to source images from elsewhere, you must obtain approval from the M&C Brand team: brand@uq.edu.au
- Avoid embedding text within images to maintain accessibility (exceptions to this must be approved by the M&C Brand team: brand@uq.edu.au).
- Include descriptive alternative text to ensure accessibility and meaningful context if images don’t load (avoid generic labels like ‘image’).

## Technical guidelines

Keep these technical guidelines in mind when testing your emails.

### Ensure mobile-friendly design

A high percentage of users open emails on their mobile devices first. Make sure your email layout is responsive and easy to scan on smaller screens and confirm that images and text scale properly for a condensed format.

### Write clear preheader text

The preheader is a snippet of text that appears after the subject line in many inboxes. Use it to complement or reinforce the subject line, giving recipients more context before they open the email.

### Provide a fallback salutation

If personalisation merges fail, include a default greeting (ie. ‘Dear Student’) to maintain a professional and personal tone even if dynamic content doesn’t load.

### Test emails across multiple email clients and devices

Ensuring consistent formatting and functionality across different email clients (such as Gmail and Outlook) and platforms (iOS and Android) enhances user experience and credibility. Always conduct thorough cross-platform testing.

### Plan for images being blocked

Some email providers or users block images by default, include HTML-based text for all critical information. Use alternative text to convey key messages when images don’t display, ensuring recipients still receive important details.
