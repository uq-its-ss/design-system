# Global footer

<StatusBadge.Development />
<StatusBadge.DraftDoc />

## Overview

The footer purpose is to provide a consistent brand, user experience and satisfy the university legal requirements.

The footer consists of five main sections.

- Reconciliation statement
- Additional support and contact navigation
- Social media links
- Organisational details
- Terms and conditions

## Default example

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story height={339} id="components-footer--footer" />
</Canvas>

## When and how to use

It is highly desireable that all websites of the University maintain a consistent digital presence. Whenever possible the complete footer should be implemented.

Software as a service (SaaS) applications and templates supplied by third party solutions may make implementation of the footer difficult.

When implementation of the full footer is not possible, a simplified approach using basic elements may be appropriate. UQ purple background combined with elements of the footer.
