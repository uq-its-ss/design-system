# Pagination
<StatusBadge.Review />

Pagination, also known as paging, is the process of dividing a document into discrete pages, either electronic pages or printed pages.

## Pagination States

The Pagination component used here has various states and has display variants based on which page it displays. For instance, if the component is displaying the first page of a series of pages, the links 'first' and 'prev' are removed. 
If the component is displaying the last page, the links 'last' and 'next' are removed. See the instances below and its html code.
