# Site header

<StatusBadge.Development /><StatusBadge.DraftDoc />

## Overview

The main navigation component is designed to work closely with the header, site title component and collapses down to a conventional open/close menu button on smaller devices. 

## Basic example

A simple one level menu list

<Canvas withSource="none" withToolbar>
  <Story height={505} id="components-site-header--site-header" />
</Canvas>

## No site title variant

For special use when no site title is required (ie UQ Homepage)

```html
<div class="uq-site-header uq-site-header--no-site-title">
  <div class="uq-site-header__title-container">
    <div class="uq-site-header__title-container__right">
      <button class="uq-site-header__navigation-toggle jsNavToggle">Menu</button>
    </div>
  </div>
```

## Site utility

The Site title section includes a small space for secondary actions. `uq-site-header__navigation-header__actions`

This is not an advertising or spam section, but intended for discrete, site wide functionality.

**Examples include:** 

* Future Students dropdown for domestic and international.
* UQ Maps, expand to fill whole screen
* UQ researchers shortlist

## Break points

* Desktop above 1140px
* Mobile and tablet below 1140px 

## Known issues

These is a bug with the close and open button, does not trigger if tabbing past the last menu item, which closes the menu and leaves the button in the incorrect state.
