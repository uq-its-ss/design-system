# Browsing POI's using list & map views

## Goal: browsing POIs *within a category* using list & map views

E.g. as a student, I want to decide what to purchase for lunch on the St. Lucia
campus

              The search query doesn't get modified upon selection of a search
              result. This behaviour is experimental and might feel "weird" at

          <tr>
            <td>
              To keep things consistent, for categories where all entries appear the same in the list (e.g. "Bike
              racks"), we should give those entries more useful names. E.g. "Bike racks - Forgan Smith North-Entrance."

          <tr>
            <td>
              When a user selects "View all in map" within a category, not only are the POI markers visible but there should also be a
              details panel open with the title of the category displayed.
            </td>

          <tr>
            <td>
              When a user selects a POI marker, there should be a details panel open which enables a user to navigate
              to/from POI, view more details, and share the POI location.

              There are currently no desktop specific component, or layout examples yet. However, a lot can be inferred
              by using the mobile-centric examples. The biggest difference between the mobile and desktop experiences
              is that the search field/results are displayed side-by-side with the map. 
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              On desktop, if the user selects a category list item from a list
              of search results, the category POIs should be highlighted on the
              always visible map. Therefore, a "view all on map" option does not
              apply at this viewport size.
