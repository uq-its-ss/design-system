# UQ Maps: wayfinding controls
<StatusBadge.Development />

## 3A. Initial state

What the wayfinding panel looks like when a user chooses to navigate to a
location.

### Basic usage

Use the HTML markup provided in the example below to apply the styles from the
provided CSS.

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Story height={240} id="deliverables-uq-maps-3-wayfinding-controls--wayfinding-control" />
</Canvas>

## 3B. With circular progress indicator

### Basic usage

Using the same HTML markup as above, except we're applying the `uq-maps__wayfinding-controls--is-working`
class to the container instead. We also have to add in some extra markup and
scripted behaviour for the [*Material Design*][1] progress indicator. Please see example
code.

<Canvas withSource="open" withToolbar>
  <Story height={240} id="deliverables-uq-maps-3-wayfinding-controls--wayfinding-control-working" />
</Canvas>
