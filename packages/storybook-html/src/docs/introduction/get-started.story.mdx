    <p><strong>The Design system is in active use in current projects at UQ.</strong> Our NPM packages are currently restricted to ITS-ADS staff with AWS tools access. If you have access, please refer to the <a href="https://confluence.its.uq.edu.au/confluence/x/0DwDCw">environment setup instructions</a>. If you do not have access, <a href="mailto:webservices@uq.edu.au">contact us</a> and we can package up styles and components for you to use in your project.</p>

There are a few ways to get started with the UQ Design System. Which method you choose depends on your project's requirements and whether you're a designer, an analyst, or a developer. **Please note that we are still working on various solutions to suit a variety of project needs.**

Here are the ways you can start using the UQ Design System right now;
- If you have prior experience with npm and Sass, [use the npm CLI to install components](#using-npm-to-install-components-into-your-project).
- If you don't have previous experience with npm or Sass, please [contact us at ADS-UI][2] for further options.
- Designers can go straight to the docs to view working examples. Also, check out the [Future Students Design System][3] (Figma project).
- If you would like a walkthrough of the docs for your analysis needs, please [contact us][2] for a tour.

## Reading the docs
Reading the documentation is an integral part of implementing the Design System.
It's where we provide:
- HTML snippets,
- JavaScript & Sass library docs,
- and guidance via standards, patterns, and systems.

## Using npm to install components into your project

Our NPM packages are currently restricted to ITS-ADS staff with AWS tools access. If you have access, please refer to the [environment setup instructions][1].

Design System packages are scoped under `@uqds`.

For example, to install buttons:

```shell
$ npm i @uqds/button
```

See the [following list of package names](#component-package-list).

## General component usage

This is not exhaustive advice on how to use each component but it should be
enough to get you started.

### Sass library

**Non-emitting code**, i.e. `@uqds/{component}/src/scss/_global.scss`, doesn't
result in any compiled CSS by itself when processed. The `@uqds/core` package is
an example of a package that only contains non-emitting code. You can use this
file wherever you need reference variables, functions, and mixins within your
own Sass stylesheets. **Our `.scss` files are written for the [primary
implementation of Sass (Dart Sass)][6]**.

We recommend using namespaces when importing the non-emitting [modules][5] into
your Sass files. For example,

```scss
// styles.scss

// With a namespace (recommended)
@use '@uqds/core/src/scss/global' as core;

// Without a namespace (no recommended)
@use '@uqds/core/src/scss/global' as *;

.example-class {
  font-size: core.$font-size-xl;
}
```

**Emitting code**, i.e. `@uqds/{component}/src/scss/_component.scss`, results in
compiled CSS when processed. This file should only be imported or compiled once
(per component) into your project. Unlike the non-emitting code, this file can be
safely imported without a namespace into Sass files. For example,

```scss
// styles.scss

@use '@uqds/button/src/scss/component' as *;
```

You can also use emitting code in your JavaScript projects. With a bundler like
Webpack (with `sass-loader`) or Rollup (with `rollup-plugin-scss`), you can import
it as a module. The following example uses the ES6 import syntax. Just remember
to [choose Dart Sass (`sass`) as the preprocessor (as opposed to `node-sass`)][7].

```javascript
// module.js

import '@uqds/button/src/scss/_component.scss';
```

### JavaScript library

Instructions coming soon after we get our house in order.
