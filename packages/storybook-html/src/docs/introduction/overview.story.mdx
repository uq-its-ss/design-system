# Overview

The UQ Design System is a guide to how user interfaces should look, feel, behave and be coded at UQ.

It includes a guide to the core styles, components, patterns and standards for UQ user interfaces. 

A package of styles and components can be provided on request.

The design system will cover the most common requirements for UI design and development at UQ. Each development project has unique needs, so you may need to adapt or extend what is provided here. If you want to share your work with others, become a contributor.

## Status and updates

The UQ Design system is currently in development and will be ready for production use at the end of 2020. You're welcome to use what we've already created, but please contact us first so we can keep you updated on changes that may affect you.
