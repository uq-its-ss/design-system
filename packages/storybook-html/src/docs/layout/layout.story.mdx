# Layout system

Our responsive layout system defines the way you should organise content and UI
components on different screen sizes. The primary elements of our layout system
are _columns_, _margins_, and _gutters_ (the schema). Our unit of measurement is
the [_rem_](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp). If this sounds a
bit too abstract, we've got you covered with a couple of basic ways to layout
your pages.

## Getting started

We recommend that you install the **`@uqds/grid`** package to use our CSS
grid classes. You can find out more in the following table and the grid
documentation.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Golden](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--golden#golden)                   | Inspired by [_The Golden Ratio_](https://www.canva.com/learn/what-is-the-golden-ratio/). A preset to give you a layout that is pleasing to the eye. |
| [Halves](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--halves#halves)                   | A two-column grid.                                                                                                                                  |
| [Thirds](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--thirds#thirds)                   | A three-column grid.                                                                                                                                |
| [Quarters](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--quarters#quarters)             | A four-column grid.                                                                                                                                 |
| [Flexible grid](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--flexible-1#flexible-grid) | Auto-sizing column grid.                                                                                                                            |
| Scrolling grid                                                      | [TODO] A grid that scrolls horizontally on mobile. Useful for holding cards.                                                                        |
| [6-8-12](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--twelve-eight-six#6-8-12-grid)    | Advanced. The most flexible option. This is an implementation of our base grid (see below).                                                         |

Secondly, we have our **`@uqds/sections`** package; CSS classes that work to
combine layout and typography. Great for laying out discrete blocks of content,
e.g. pull quotes, calls to action, landing page sections etc.

## Our base grid

Our layout system is built upon a **6-8-12 column** strategy — our base grid.
The grid forms the basis of our layout system **when and only when** applied to
the entire viewport width. The layout system is currently 1-dimensional
(horizontal only).

### Specifications per viewport (width) range

## Designing with the base grid (for UI mockups)

Designers should prepare mockups for our three major viewport ranges\*:

- mobile: using a 375px width artboard,
- tablet: using a 768px width artboard,
- and desktop/laptop: using a 1440px artboard.

> \* Because we are picking just three discrete sizes as standard, as we are
> implementing the UI elements, we must test the responsiveness in the browser.

In some UI design programs (e.g. Figma, Adobe XD), you can define a layout grid
using the column, margin, and gutter (px) values we've supplied. You can also
use the following sizing/spacing reference images.

### Mobile

## Glossary

### Columns

Columns are the areas of space where content can be displayed. Column width is
calculated based on percentages and gutter width.

### Gutters

A gutter is the spacing between columns. They are fixed-width but the value
changes to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Margins

Margins are the space on either side of the entire row of columns. They are
specified using a minimum width because they change to adapt to different screen
sizes. I.e. we use wider margins for larger screens. Therefore, to ensure that
larger screens always have a wider set of columns than smaller screens, we
perform an easing technique from one margin ideal to the next ideal. Think of it
as counter-balancing the big jumps in margin width.
