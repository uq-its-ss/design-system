## Overview

The blockquote component is used for quoting a passage of text or speech, the author, and the source. 

## Default

Displays the blockquote text, author, and source in purple text for use on light backgrounds such as white or light-grey.

<Canvas>
  <Story height={170} id="components-blockquote--blockquote" />
</Canvas>

```html
<figure class="blockquote">
    <blockquote class="blockquote__body">
        <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="blockquote__footer">
        —Aldous Huxley, <cite><a href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html" class="blockquote__link">Brave New World</a></cite>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Variants

### Light 

Changes the colour of the blockquote text to white so it can be used on darker backgrounds such as UQ purple. 

<Canvas>
  <Story height={170} id="components-blockquote--blockquote-light" />
</Canvas>

```html
<figure class="blockquote blockquote--light">
    <blockquote class="blockquote__body">
        <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="blockquote__footer">
        —Aldous Huxley, <cite><a href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html" class="blockquote__link">Brave New World</a></cite>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

## How and when to use
* The quoted content is contained in the ```blockquote``` element. The author and source are placed outside that element so they do not become a part of the quoted content. 
* If referencing the source of the quote, the source title should be placed in a ```cite``` element. This element should only contain the title of the source, not the author as the author is not considered the source according to the specifcations of the ```cite``` element. 
* The use of the blockquote element indicates the text is a quotation from another source. It should not be used for visual styling of other content.

## Accessibility
The ```blockquote``` element is a semantic element and does not require additonal accessibility labels.
