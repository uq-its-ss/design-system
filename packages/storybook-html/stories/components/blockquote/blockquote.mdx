# Blockquote

## Overview

The blockquote component is used for quoting a passage of text or speech, the author, and the source.

## Default

Displays the blockquote text, author, and source in purple text for use on light backgrounds such as white or light-grey.

<Canvas of={BlockquoteStories.Blockquote} sourceState="none" />

<Source of={BlockquoteStories.Blockquote} />

## Variants

### Light

Changes the colour of the blockquote text to white so it can be used on darker backgrounds such as UQ purple.

<Canvas
  of={BlockquoteStories.Light}
  sourceState="none"
  className="sb-purple-background"
/>

<Source of={BlockquoteStories.Light} />

## How and when to use

- The quoted content is contained in the `blockquote` element. The author and source are placed outside that element so they do not become a part of the quoted content.
- If referencing the source of the quote, the source title should be placed in a `cite` element. This element should only contain the title of the source, not the author as the author is not considered the source according to the specifcations of the `cite` element.
- The use of the blockquote element indicates the text is a quotation from another source. It should not be used for visual styling of other content.

## Accessibility

The `blockquote` element is a semantic element and does not require additonal accessibility labels.
