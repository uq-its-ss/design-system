## Overview

The `@uqds/body` package provides basic HTML element styles, basic print styles, and utility
classes.

## Install as a dependency

```bash
npm i @uqds/body
```

```bash
yarn add @uqds/body
```

## Basic usage with Sass

```scss
// With a namespace (recommended)
@use "@uqds/body/src/scss/_component" as body;

// Without a namespace
@use "@uqds/body/src/scss/_component" as *;
```

## ⚠️ Encapsulating the styles (in Sass) for established projects

This stylesheet can affect HTML elements globally and provides non-prefixed
utility CSS classes. If you are modifying an existing project with base styles
already in place, we recommended importing the stylesheet with encapsulation
enabled (to avoid selector clashes).

```scss
@use "@uqds/body/src/scss/_component" as body with (
  $use-encapsulation: true
);
```

You can now wrap any amount of HTML content with the `uq` class to apply the
package stylesheet to a subset of elements. For example:

```html
...
<div class="uq">
  <h2>
    I will be styled with
    <span class="text--weight-medium">this</span> stylesheet.
  </h2>
  <p>As will I.</p>
</div>
...
```

You can also apply the `uq` class to the `<body>` tag to use the styles globally
(e.g. to add more [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
to the resulting CSS). Otherwise, by default, this stylesheet will effect the
`body` tag and its descendants globally anyway.

```html
<body class="uq">
  ...
</body>
```
