## Overview

The footer purpose is to provide a consistent brand, user experience and satisfy the university legal requirements.

The footer consists of five main sections.

- Reconciliation statement
- Additional support and contact navigation
- Social media links
- Organisational details
- Terms and conditions

## Default example

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story of={FooterStories.footer} />
</Canvas>

<Figma url="https://www.figma.com/file/Li7SZkmaLgw8ZdiHje2q7x/One-UQ-component-library?type=design&node-id=3853-2229&mode=design&t=8G1CIvJ297Ruw5u5-4" />

## When and how to use

It is highly desireable that all websites of the University maintain a consistent digital presence. Whenever possible the complete footer should be implemented.

Software as a service (SaaS) applications and templates supplied by third party solutions may make implementation of the footer difficult.

When implementation of the full footer is not possible, a simplified approach using basic elements may be appropriate. UQ purple background combined with elements of the footer.
