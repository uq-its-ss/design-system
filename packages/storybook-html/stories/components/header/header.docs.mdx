# Global header

<StatusBadge.Stable />
<StatusBadge.Stable />

## Overview

The headers purpose is to introduce branding and make the site instantly recognizable to those who are already familiar with UQ.
It also provides a consistent information architecture (navigation structure) for our websites.

## Default example

### Header interim

The interim header is suitable for a broad range of sites and applications, it includes the following sections:

- The primary section includes the UQ logo, Primary navigation (Study, Research, Partners and community, about) and search using [_UQ Search_](https://www.uq.edu.au/search).
- The secondary section provides navigation to UQ home, News, Events, Give and contact.
- An optional third navigation section is available on mobile when paired with the [Site header component](?path=/docs/components-site-header--site-header-with-subnav), which provides site title and local navigation options. This combines to provide a stacked mobile menu of all three sections (Local, primary and secondary navigation).

### Header with mega menu

Currently reserved for the UQ Homepage and level one landing pages for Study, Research, Partners & community and about.

- The primary section includes the UQ logo, Primary navigation (Study, Research, Partners and community, about) with an extended drop down information architecture (mega menu) and search using [_UQ Search_](https://www.uq.edu.au/search).
- The secondary section provides navigation to UQ home, News, Events, Give and contact.

### Usage

Use JavaScript to initialize the component to ensure it will work as expected.

```js
  // Initialise header
  const headerElem = document.querySelector('.uq-header');
  new uq.header(headerElem);

  const appHeight = () => {
    const doc = document.documentElement
    doc.style.setProperty('--app-height', `${window.innerHeight}px`)
    }
  window.addEventListener('resize', appHeight)
  appHeight()
```

## Variant examples

### Header simplified

When implementation of the full header is not possible, a simplified approach using basic elements may be appropriate.
UQ purple background combined with the UQ logo make up the most important elements of the header.

<Story height={120} id="components-header--basic-header" />

### Default search

The default option is a global search of all UQ. The search feature sends users to results on [_UQ Search_](https://www.uq.edu.au/search).

> Don't reappropriate the search function for special integrated search
> functionality within your application e.g. searching for a location on a map,
> searching for books or articles in a library database.

<Story id="components-header--search-global" />

### Global and local search

You can optionally provide two radio fields, allowing users to choose to search all UQ sites or just the content on your site.

> \*If your application/website isn't indexed by UQ Search, it may impact what results are provided by a restricted search.

<Story height={120} id="components-header--search-local" />

```html
<div class="uq-header__search-range">
  <input
    type="radio"
    id="edit-as_sitesearch-off"
    name="as_sitesearch"
    value=""
    class="form-radio uq-header__search-radio"
  />
  <label for="edit-as_sitesearch-off" class="option uq-header__search-label"
    >Search all UQ websites</label
  >
</div>
<div class="uq-header__search-range">
  <input
    type="radio"
    id="edit-as_sitesearch-on"
    name="as_sitesearch"
    value="https://future-students.uq.edu.au"
    checked="checked"
    class="form-radio uq-header__search-radio"
  />
  <label for="edit-as_sitesearch-on" class="option uq-header__search-label"
    >Search this website (future-students.uq.edu.au)</label
  >
</div>
```

## When and how to use

It is highly desireable that all websites of the University maintain a consistent digital presence.
Whenever possible the complete header should be implemented.
Optionally pair with the [Site header component](?path=/docs/components-site-header--site-header-with-subnav) to provide a site title and local navigation.

Software as a service (SaaS) applications and templates supplied by third party solutions may make implementation of the header difficult.

We recommend simplifying the header to basic elements [_Header simplified_](?path=/docs/components-header--basic-header).

## Accessibility

Every navigation `<nav>` includes an aria label, for example:

```html
<nav aria-label="primary navigation"></nav>
```
