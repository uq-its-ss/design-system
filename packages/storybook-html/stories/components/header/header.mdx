# Global header

<StatusBadge.Stable />

<StatusBadge.Stable />

## Overview

The headers purpose is to introduce branding and make the site instantly recognizable to those who are already familiar with UQ.
It also provides a consistent information architecture (navigation structure) for our websites.

### Header with mega menu

Currently reserved for the UQ Homepage and level one landing pages for Study, Research, Partners & community and about.

- The primary section includes the UQ logo, Primary navigation (Study, Research, Partners and community, about) with an extended drop down information architecture (mega menu) and search using [_UQ Search_](https://search.uq.edu.au).
- The secondary section provides navigation to UQ home, News, Events, Give and contact.

<Canvas
  of={HeaderStories.Default}
  story={{
    autoplay: true,
    height: "200px",
  }}
/>
<Controls of={HeaderStories.Default} />

### Usage

Use JavaScript to initialize the component to ensure it will work as expected.

```js
// Initialise header
const headerElem = document.querySelector(".uq-header");
new uq.header(headerElem);

const appHeight = () => {
  const doc = document.documentElement;
  doc.style.setProperty("--app-height", `${window.innerHeight}px`);
};
window.addEventListener("resize", appHeight);
appHeight();
```

## Variant examples

### Header interim

The interim header is suitable for a broad range of sites and applications, it includes the following sections:

- The primary section includes the UQ logo, Primary navigation (Study, Research, Partners and community, about) and search using [_UQ Search_](https://search.uq.edu.au).
- The secondary section provides navigation to UQ home, News, Events, Give and contact.
- An optional third navigation section is available on mobile when paired with the [Site header component](?path=/docs/components-site-header--site-header-with-subnav), which provides site title and local navigation options. This combines to provide a stacked mobile menu of all three sections (Local, primary and secondary navigation).

<Canvas
  of={HeaderStories.WithoutMegaMenu}
  story={{
    autoplay: true,
    height: "200px",
  }}
/>

### Header simplified

When implementation of the full header is not possible, a simplified approach using basic elements may be appropriate.
UQ purple background combined with the UQ logo make up the most important elements of the header.
