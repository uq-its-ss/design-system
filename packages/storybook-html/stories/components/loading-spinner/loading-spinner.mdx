## Overview

The loading spinner component is a progress indicator used to provide feedback that data is being processed.

## Default

The default component is UQ purple for use on light backgrounds such as white or light-grey.

<Canvas of={LoadingSpinnerStories.loadingSpinner} />

```html
<div class="uq-loading-spinner" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```

## Variants

The variants can be used in isolation or combined. For example if you would like a light and small loading spinner, add both of the variant classnames to the component.

### Light

Changes the colour of the component to white so it can be used on darker backgrounds such as UQ purple.

<Canvas of={LoadingSpinnerStories.loadingSpinnerLight} />

```html
<div
  class="uq-loading-spinner uq-loading-spinner--light"
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
>
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```

### Small

Reduces the component to half the size of the default.

<Canvas of={LoadingSpinnerStories.loadingSpinnerSmall} />

```html
<div
  class="uq-loading-spinner uq-loading-spinner--small"
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
>
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```

## Nesting

Loading spinners can be used inside certain other components.

### Button

<Canvas of={LoadingSpinnerStories.loadingSpinnerButton} />

```html
<button class="uq-button">
    <i
      class="uq-loading-spinner"
      role="alert"
      aria-live="assertive"
      ></i>
    Submit
</button>
```

## How and when to use

The loading spinner component can be used to represent the loading of data in a page or within a component.

## Accessibility

To ensure screen readers notifiy users that page content is loading, include `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`.
