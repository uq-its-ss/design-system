## Overview

The loading spinner component is a progress indicator used to provide feedback that data is being processed.

## Default

The default component is UQ purple for use on light backgrounds such as white or light-grey.

  <Story id="components-loading-spinner--loading-spinner" />
</Canvas>

```html
<div class="uq-loading-spinner" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```

## Variants

The variants can be used in isolation or combined. For example if you would like a light and small loading spinner, add both of the variant classnames to the component.

### Light

Changes the colour of the component to white so it can be used on darker backgrounds such as UQ purple.

```html
<div
  class="uq-loading-spinner uq-loading-spinner--light"
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
>
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```

### Small

Reduces the component to half the size of the default.

```html
<div
  class="uq-loading-spinner uq-loading-spinner--small"
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
>
  <span>Loading...</span>
</div>
```
