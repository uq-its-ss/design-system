# Browsing POI's using list & map views

## Goal: browsing POIs _within a category_ using list & map views

E.g. as a student, I want to decide what to purchase for lunch on the St. Lucia
campus

                This flow can be started with any map state. Thoughtout this

                take the place of the START map state (changes indicated by

              To keep things consistent, for categories where all entries appear
              the same in the list (e.g. "Bike racks"), we should give those
              entries more useful names. E.g. "Bike racks - Forgan Smith
              North-Entrance."

          <tr>
            <td>
              When a user selects "View all in map" within a category, not only
              are the POI markers visible but there should also be a details
              panel open with the title of the category displayed.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>
              When a user selects a POI marker, there should be a details panel
              open which enables a user to navigate to/from POI, view more
              details, and share the POI location.

              There are currently no desktop specific component, or layout
              examples yet. However, a lot can be inferred by using the
              mobile-centric examples. The biggest difference between the mobile
              and desktop experiences is that the search field/results are
              displayed side-by-side with the map.

          <tr>
            <td>
              On desktop, if the user selects a category list item from a list
              of search results, the category POIs should be highlighted on the
              always visible map. Therefore, a "view all on map" option does not
              apply at this viewport size.
