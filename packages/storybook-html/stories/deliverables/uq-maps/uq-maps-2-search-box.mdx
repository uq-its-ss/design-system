# UQ Maps: search field

<StatusBadge.Development />

Enables the user to search for points of interest and categories.

## 2A. Initial state

### Basic usage

Use the HTML markup provided in the example below to apply the styles from the
provided CSS.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  {/* <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field" /> is deprecated, please migrate it to <Story of={referenceToStory} /> see: https://storybook.js.org/migration-guides/7.0 */}

  <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field" />
</Canvas>

## 2B. On focus or selecting origin/destination

What the search field looks like when a user clicks or taps the search bar but
hasn't entered any text yet. Identical to when it is used to let a user choose
an origin or destination in wayfinding mode.

### Basic usage

Using the same HTML markup as above, also apply the `uq-maps__search-field--is-focused`
class to the container.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  {/* <Story height={200} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-focused" /> is deprecated, please migrate it to <Story of={referenceToStory} /> see: https://storybook.js.org/migration-guides/7.0 */}

  <Story height={200} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-focused" />
</Canvas>

## 2C. With search value

What the search field looks like when there has been text entered.

### Basic usage

Using the same HTML markup as above, except we're applying the `uq-maps__search-field--is-searching`
class to the container instead.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  {/* <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-searching" /> is deprecated, please migrate it to <Story of={referenceToStory} /> see: https://storybook.js.org/migration-guides/7.0 */}

  <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-searching" />
</Canvas>

## 2D. With circular progression indicator

What the search field looks like when the app is working on a search query.

### Basic usage

Using the same HTML markup as above and also applying the `uq-maps__search-field--is-working`
class to the container instead. We also have to add in some extra markup and
scripted behaviour for the [*Material Design*][1] progress indicator. Please see
example code.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  {/* <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-working" /> is deprecated, please migrate it to <Story of={referenceToStory} /> see: https://storybook.js.org/migration-guides/7.0 */}

  <Story height={120} id="deliverables-uq-maps-2-search-field--search-field-working" />
</Canvas>
