# UQ Maps: wayfinding controls

<StatusBadge.Development />

## 3A. Initial state

What the wayfinding panel looks like when a user chooses to navigate to a
location.

### Basic usage

Use the HTML markup provided in the example below to apply the styles from the
provided CSS.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" withToolbar>
  <Story of={UqMaps3WayfindingControlsStories.wayfindingControl} autoplay />
</Canvas>

## 3B. With circular progress indicator

### Basic usage

Using the same HTML markup as above, except we're applying the `uq-maps__wayfinding-controls--is-working`
class to the container instead. We also have to add in some extra markup and
scripted behaviour for the [_Material Design_][1] progress indicator. Please see example
code.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" withToolbar>
  <Story
    of={UqMaps3WayfindingControlsStories.wayfindingControlWorking}
    autoplay
  />
</Canvas>
