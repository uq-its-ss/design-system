## Overview

Layouts using our grid are achieved using a combination of `.uq-grid` (_grid
container_) and `.uq-grid__col` (_grid column_) elements and their modifiers.

> ⚠️ Important: **grid containers should be afforded the entire width of the
> viewport** (naturally, this doesn't apply to _nested_ and _full-width_ grids).

## Golden

This grid gives you a _main_ content column and a _sidebar_ column that stack
for mobile. Under the hood, is our _6-8-12_ grid so you can keep your content
consistently aligned with the base grid.

<Story of={GridStories.golden} />

### How-to

Add two `.uq-grid__col` elements within a grid container (with the
`.uq-grid--golden` modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--golden">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Main content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Aside</div>
</div>
```

See what happens when you add more columns to the same container!

> All of our grid rows get the same gutter (gap) as columns by default. So, when
> columns stack, your contents are conveniently spaced out.

## Halves

Behaves like _Golden_ but has two columns of equal size at larger screen sizes.

<Story of={GridStories.halves} />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--halves">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Thirds

Behaves like _Golden_ but has three columns of equal size at larger screen
sizes.

<Story of={GridStories.thirds} />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--thirds">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Quarters

Behaves like _Golden_ but has four columns of equal size at larger screen sizes.

<Story of={GridStories.quarters} />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--quarters">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Flexible grid

The flexible grid leverages the power of [_CSS Grid Layout_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
to give you a quick & flexible layout solution. You can use this grid to
organise your content into columns that stack when browser sizes are smaller.
Therefore, it makes it an ideal solution for arranging linear material.

<Story of={GridStories.flexible1} />

### How-to

As an example, you can achieve three columns of content by adding three
`.uq-grid__col` elements to the grid container (with the `.uq-grid--flexible`
modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">1st item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">2nd item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">3rd item</div>
</div>
```

<Story of={GridStories.flexible2} />

Pay attention to what the grid does when the screens get very small.

## 6-8-12 grid

If you're looking for more control over your layout, we've built a grid that
adapts the number of available columns to different screen sizes. It's a 6-, 8-,
and 12-column grid built into one CSS class system! Starting from _mobile_, the
_column-span_ classes give you the freedom to craft layouts to suit different
screen sizes.

> By default, we add the [specified margins](?path=/docs/layout-layout--base-layout-grid-visualised#specifications-per-breakpoint)
> to both sides of the column row _and_ apply a max-width on XL screens on the
> root `.uq-grid` node.

### Basic how-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div
    class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8"
  >
    Content
  </div>
  <div
    class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--2 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4"
  >
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixExample1} />

### Stacking columns for smaller screens

To prevent your columns from getting too small, you can stack columns by
"overflowing" the row. For example, see what we're doing here with the smallest
layout with the grid:

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div
    class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8"
  >
    Content
  </div>
  <div
    class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4"
  >
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

The difference between this example and the one before is that the two columns
take up the whole available width for the smallest screens.

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixExample2} />

### The 6-column grid column-span classes (designed for _mobile_ displays)

Create layouts for the smallest screens.

`uq-grid__col--[1—6]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4">...</div>`

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixMobile} />

### The 8-column grid column-span classes (designed for _tablet_ displays)

Shift the layout for larger screens.

`uq-grid__col--md-[1—8]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6">...</div>`

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixTablet} />

### The 12-column grid column-span classes (designed for _desktop/laptop_ displays)

Shift the layout for the largest screens.

`uq-grid__col--xl-[1—12]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6 uq-grid__col--xl-8">...</div>`

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixDesktop} /> >

## Nesting grids

You can nest grids, i.e. place another grid container within a grid column, to
create nested layouts. However, columns can become too narrow if you nest too
deeply or use small column spans.

<Story of={GridStories.twelveEightSixNested} />

### Example using the 6-8-12 grid

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6">
    Content
    <!-- Nested grid -->
    <div class="uq-grid">
      <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--3 uq-grid__col--xl-7">Nested</div>
      <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--3 uq-grid__col--xl-5">Nested</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--2 uq-grid__col--md-2">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Full-width grid

If you want to manage the margins yourself, i.e. nest the grid in your own
custom container, you can apply the `uq-grid--full-width` modifier class. This
variant is created with the intention that it will be used to develop layouts
from a designed mockup or design advice. It is expected that spacing rules will
still followed.

#### Example: 6-8-12 grid

```html
<!-- using a custom container that has padding -->
<div class="my-custom-container">
  <div class="uq-grid uq-grid--full-width">
    <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--3">Your content</div>
    <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--3">Your content</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="deprecated-grid--twelve-eight-six-full-width" />

#### Example: flexible grid

```html
<!-- using a custom container that has padding -->
<div class="my-custom-container">
  <div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible uq-grid--full-width">
    <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
    <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
    <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
    <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
    <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Story of={GridStories.flexible1} />

## Alternative layout container

The `.uq-layout-container` class can be used as an alternative to using a grid
container (`.uq-grid`) and a full length grid column (`.uq-grid__col`).

> ⚠️ Important: **layout container should be afforded the entire width of the
> viewport**.

```html
<div class="uq-layout-container">Hello world!</div>

<!-- Equivalent using grid classes -->
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6">Hello world!</div>
</div>
```

<Story of={GridStories.layoutContainer} />

## SASS mixins

The `@uqds/grid` package provides [_mixins_](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin)
to help you develop your own CSS rules using Sass such that they align with our
layout system.

### `layout-containment`

Modifies the `margin-[left, right]` and `max-width` properties of your element
to contain the contents in a grid container fashion.

```html
<!-- custom.html -->

<!-- ... -->

<div class="my-custom-container">Hello world!</div>

<!-- ... -->
```

```scss
/* custom.scss */

// First, import and declare namespace for the grid mixins file
@use "@uqds/grid/src/scss/global" as grid;

.my-custom-container {
  // Then, use the mixin like so:
  @include grid.layout-containment;

  // ...
}

// ...
```
