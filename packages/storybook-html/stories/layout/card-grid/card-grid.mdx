# Card grid

<StatusBadge.Development />

## Overview

The `.uq-card-grid` component is the preferred way to layout `.uq-card`
components. The markup structure is considerably simplified and easy to use.

The component uses container queries to ensure cards are displayed correctly at
all screen sizes, based on a target number of cards per row.

### How-to

Wrap elements directly in a `.uq-card-grid` element and choose a
target cards per row modifier class.

The child element should be a `.uq-card` or `.ud-pane` however any element that
does not implement its own margins will work.

```html
<div class="uq-card-grid uq-card-grid--target-3x">
  <div class="uq-card"></div>
  <div class="uq-card"></div>
  <div class="uq-card"></div>
  <div class="uq-card"></div>
</div>
```

### One per row

In this target size, cards will display full width at all times.

Modifier class: `.uq-card-grid--target-1x`

<Canvas sourceState="hidden">
  <Story of={CardGridStories.OnePerRow} />
</Canvas>

### Two per row

Cards will typically display two per row except on some mobile devices.

Modifier class: `.uq-card-grid--target-2x`

<Canvas sourceState="hidden">
  <Story of={CardGridStories.TwoPerRow} />
</Canvas>

### Three per row

Cards will display three per row on most screen sizes, two per row on smaller
devices and one per row on mobile devices.

Modifier class: `.uq-card-grid--target-3x`

<Canvas sourceState="hidden">
  <Story of={CardGridStories.ThreePerRow} />
</Canvas>

### Four per row

Cards will only display at four per row on large screens in a full width
container. Otherwise they will display a three or two per row, and one per row
on mobile devices.

Modifier class: `.uq-card-grid--target-4x`

<Canvas sourceState="hidden">
  <Story of={CardGridStories.FourPerRow} />
</Canvas>
