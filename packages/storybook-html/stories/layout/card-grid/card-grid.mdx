# Card grid

<StatusBadge.Development />
<StatusBadge.DraftDoc />

## Overview

The `.uq-card-grid` component is the preferred way to layout `.uq-card`
components. The markup structure is considerably simplified and easy to use.

The component uses container queries to ensure cards are displayed correctly at
all screen sizes, based on a target number of cards per row.

### How-to

Wrap elements directly in a `.uq-card-grid` element and choose one of the
target cards per row modifier classes below.

- `.uq-card-grid--target-1x`
- `.uq-card-grid--target-2x`
- `.uq-card-grid--target-3x`
- `.uq-card-grid--target-4x`

The child elements should be a `.uq-card` or `.uq-pane` to ensure that the
height of cards on each row is uniform.
