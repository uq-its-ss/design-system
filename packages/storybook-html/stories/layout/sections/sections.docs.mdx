## Overview

The `.uq-sections` component provides correct **section spacing** between sections by using
a responsive `96px` and `48px` gap for desktop and tablet/mobile respectively.

### How-to

Use the `.uq-sections` element anywhere you need to provide **section spacing**.

Any child element will be spaced correctly providing it does not implement its
own `margin` property.

`.uq-sections` elements can be safely nested within each other as needed.

<Canvas sourceState='hidden'>
  <Story of={SectionsStories.Sections} />
</Canvas>

```html
<div class="uq-sections">
  <div class="uq-section"></div>
  <div class="uq-section"></div>
  <div class="uq-section"></div>
</div>
```
