# Usage

To use `@uqds/react` components follow these steps.

## Installation

First install the React package.

```bash
npm i @uqds/react
```

## CSS

CSS styles for all components are bundled into a single CSS import you'll need to add to your
project globally.

### PostCSS

```css
@import "@uqds/react";
```

### Sass

```css
@use "@uqds/react/src/scss/main" as react;
```

### JS

```js
import "design-system/packages/react/dist/css/main.css";
```

Alternatively individual components can be imported from the component packages, for example.

```css
@import "@uqds/icon";
```

## Component usage

Follow the docs page of each component for individual component usage.
